## Tools and Technologies Used :
Python,Machine Learning,Sklearn,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Numpy,Streamlit.

## Data Collection :
I have gathered dataset from Kaggle for this project.

## EDA and Data cleaning:
Perform eda and data cleaning and on dataset and selected only those features which was mandatory for model building .

## Similarity Score :
in this project i have used basically simlarity score which  it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes? 
It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.

## Model Deployment:
save the model and loaded it Pycharm to delpoy it. for converting into web-app i have used streamlit.
